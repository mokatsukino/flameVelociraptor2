I had a lot of fun during this week's classes because I'm getting closer and closer to the clock I want to finish working out. My clock has changed from the original; That being a 'clock' that uses 3 different spheres pulled from Pintrest to be used as the hour, minute, and second, touching the sides of the canvas based on each form of time.
