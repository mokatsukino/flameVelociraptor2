trying again..

This is an attempt at the relfection piece that is due by every Sunday, still trying to figure what everything means on GitHub because nothing makes sense right now..  I'm not even sure this is how I'm supposed to write this entry in here but I am hoping and praying...
I've started on a rough draft of what I could do for this first project and I will share a link to a open Google Docs page to show a screenshot because I am NOT trying to figure out implementing photos on here yet. https://docs.google.com/document/d/11SaF2OlSV8Gz8LywXgB4rexbQ7jM7bpiC9Bq11i7ecs/edit?tab=t.0

Although the goal is to make an abstract visual representation of time, I am very in to reflecting on 'real life' and putting that into a feeling through visual representation. I still think that a clock can look like a normal clock, just.. the  way it fuctions is going to be odd and eerie. Much like in our real world. I want my clock to feel kinda creepy and confusing by using color and messing around with the non-linear motion of the hands on a clock. I also think it'd be super fun to change the pattern of the moving clock hands depending on the certain hours of the day and how it makes me feel personally, cause I don't know if it fully resonates with everyone. 
But yeah, outline.
